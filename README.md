# ðŸ‘¤ User Login Activity Analysis (SQL Project)

This SQL project analyzes user login behavior over time to extract meaningful insights such as user engagement, session trends, and inactivity patterns.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Understanding user login activity is essential for measuring engagement, system usage, and retention. This project aims to support operational and strategic decisions by:

- Identifying users with extended inactivity
- Analyzing session trends over quarters
- Detecting consistently active users
- Pinpointing inactive days in the system

The goal is to transform raw login data into actionable insights for product, HR, and IT teams.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Identify users who havenâ€™t logged in for the past 5 months
- Analyze quarterly login session counts and track session growth
- Detect users who logged in during one period but missed others (e.g., Jan 2024 vs Nov 2023)
- Find users with the highest session score each day
- Identify power users who logged in every day since their first login
- Find dates when **no users** logged into the system
